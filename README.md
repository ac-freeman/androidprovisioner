*Manual for setting up and using the program: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yewSL3pQPfk9bMRWnn3NvePSLfFwT9QXfeQhjKTv04I/edit?usp=sharing


MAJOR ISSUE: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/1314556

This confirmed bug is two years old, and no progress has been made on solving it. It is not clear at this point how much this bug will affect the use of provisioning tool. I will try to explore other Linux distros that may not have this issue, but this will severely complicate the process of installing ADB on the computers if the distro does not use PPA. 


ACTION ITEMS FOR THE FUTURE:

*   User login and authentication

*   Automatic updating of program
