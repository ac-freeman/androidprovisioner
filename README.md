Designed to run on Linux

Takes advantage of the ADB Linux driver, to run install processes on multiple devices simultaneously. The Android devices do not to be rooted or unlocked, but must have developer settings enabled. This tool can "provision" devices in the sense that a suite of specified applications are installed to each to device. This is useful if many different types of devices are targeted, if the devices cannot be rooted, or if a work profile cannot be established. It was designed to be used by aftermarket resellers to install their own apps on devices, to generate revenue and improve customer experience.

Tested with up to 16 devices provisioned at once

Sorry I don't have documentation on how to setup/use the tool
